# DATA130045.01-Graph-Data-Management-And-Mining

* In project 1, we focus on the problem of frequent subgraph pattern mining over a single large graph, we implement a Gspan-like algorithm with Python based on a python Gspan version, and implement a state-of-the-art subgraph matching algorithm [DP-iso](https://github.com/TrueNobility303/DP-iso) with C++ as a sub-problem.

* In project 2, we focus on the problem of dynamic subgraph matching, i.e. the data graph evolves over time. We propose our algorithm based on both on Success Set and Failure Set, and we also proposed an incremental Gcode algorithm for prunning with bounds for eigenvalues. 

* In project 3, we focus on the problem of graph similarity search over a graph database, we improved the method of Noah with Ranknet to get a better performance on top-k problem setting, i.e. to find top-k similar graphs from database $D$ to given pattern graph $P$.
